The main goal of this project was to implement/create an AI capable of playing [Reversi/Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) against a human player. The system was created using [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) programming language and it was used the Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning and we also used some heuristics based on ["An Analysis of Heuristics in Othello" paper](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse573/04au/Project/mini1/RUSSIA/Final_Paper.pdf).
This project was developed in the Advanced Algorithms course (an introduction to artificial intelligence).
**The final grade was 19.7/20.**
